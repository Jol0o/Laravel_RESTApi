## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

# Laravel Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up this Laravel project on a new device.

## Prerequisites

- PHP >= 7.3
- Composer
- Laravel CLI
- MySQL (or any database system supported by Laravel)
- Git

## Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` and `yourrepository` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

    ```bash
    cd yourrepository
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Copy the .env.example file**

    Laravel uses the `.env` file to manage environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate an application key**

    Laravel requires an application key for encrypting data. Generate one using the following command:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Set up the database**

    Open the `.env` file and update the database settings:

    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

    Replace `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with your actual database name, username, and password.

7. **Run migrations**

    Run the following command to create the tables in the database:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8. **Start the server**

    Start the Laravel development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    You should now be able to access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
